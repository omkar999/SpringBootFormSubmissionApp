# SpringBootFormSubmissionApp

This is a simple spring boot jdbc template application developed in `Eclipse` with `Maven` plugin.

Run the `DemoApplication.java` as a java Application. Then the embedded Tomcat Server will be started and the application will be deployed.

The URL `http://localhost:8080/` will return `index.html` page.
Enter the `firstname` and the `lastname` and click on `submit` button.
Then these details will be added to the `user` table in MySQL Database.
